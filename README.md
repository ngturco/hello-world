# hello-world
A beginning repository
I am starting a GitHub page to create my portfolio and store the code that I work on.
I am re-sharpening my skills. I was a junior programmer back in 2008-2009 at a health care software company. But I need to get back into the swing of things. I have a number of ideas. The first is basically an IRC client, but it looks like a 3d wireframe world, where you have a character and can move around, but still chat. Another idea is a clock that you can interact with.
